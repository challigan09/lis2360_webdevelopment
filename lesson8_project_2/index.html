He was also an author, printer, political theorist, freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, himorist, statesmen, and diplomat. He is by far, my favorite invenntor/philothopist of all time.

He most notable achievement is cofounder of Microsoft Corportation. At the age of 13, Bill wrote hist first software program. A drop-out of Harvard University, Bill went to work developing software for the first microcomputers. In addition to his time spent at microsoft, Bill Gates is also one of the biggest philanthropist of my time. The Gates Foundation, a program created with his wife, Melinda, funds many health programs around the world. Many of these programs were created to build literacy among children, as well as to focus on global development. </p>

As of today, he current holds more than 440 U.S. and foreign patents. Most of his patents are for innovative medical devices. his first invention, while in college I might add, was a wearable infusion pump. In 1976, he founded his own company, AutoSyringe, inc., to manufacture and market the pumps.
