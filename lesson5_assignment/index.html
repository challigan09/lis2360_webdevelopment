    <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
    
    <!--Paragraph Introduction-->
    <p>Technology continues to change our lives and reshape how we do things.Its no secret that we have a greater dependence on it now more than ever before in our history. Nevertheless, is technology the key to solving global problems? Undoubly, yes. It is through technology that we can create and apply innovative solutions to overcome many global issues of the 21st century.

    <!--Technology Medical solutions  -->
    <p>Advancements in medical technology have not only helped Physicians diagnose and treat patients more efficently, it has redefined the entire healthcare system. Innovations of modern medicine, such as medical devices, procedures, early diasnostics, and prescription drugs, have drastically increased life expectancy rates through out the world. Electronic medical records (EMR) and mobile technologies, such as smartphones and tablets, provides physicians better access to their patients and allows patients to stay more informed. Paper charts were largely inefficient and often contained medical mistakes.         </p>

    <!--Humanitarian solutions  -->
    <p> It is estimated that close to 815 million people were suffering from chronic undernourishment in 2016. The vast majority of these people live in a developing country with little to no certainty of when they will eat next. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, or FAO, estimates that nearly half (45%) of deaths in children under fived are contributed to poor nutrition. That is roughly 3.1 million children who are affected each year.  </p>

    <!--Renewable energy solutions -->    
    <p>Earth's climate is constantly changing! The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA, went on record predicting that the planet's average surface temperature has risen more than 1.61 degrees fahrenheit since the 19th century. This rapid change in temperature is attributed from increased carbon dioxide emissions and other green house gasses getting trapped in earths atmosphere. Most climate scientists agree, the main cause of the current global warming trend is in large part due to human reliance on burning fossil fuels as a means of energy. This method is largely inefficent and posse serious health risks, as well as damaging impacts on the environment. So whats the solution to curb this growing trend? TECHNOLOGY IS THE SOLUTION! By converting to clean, renewable energy, we have the opportunity to curtail global warming and invest in our children's future. </p>
